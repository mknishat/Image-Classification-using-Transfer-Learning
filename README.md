# Image-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning
This tutorial introduces PyTorch and how to use pre-trained models for image classification. Pre-trained models offer excellent performance with minimal effort, as they have already learned visual features from large datasets.  Here use a ResNet-50 model pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tune that model on the MiniPlaces dataset.
